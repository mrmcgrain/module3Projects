User Story #2: Markdown Previewer

● I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

● I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

● When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to
display the content of the textarea.

● When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as
HTML in the #preview element as I type.

● When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should
contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a
heading element (H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code
block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

● When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field
should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.

● Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): My markdown previewer
interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.
